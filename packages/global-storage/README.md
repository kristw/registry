> A simple key-value store singleton.

Sometimes you have to do horrible things, like use the global object to share a singleton or some values.

Instead of attaching values to the global object, which can lead to security concerns, this `global-storage` package provides a key-value `store` which is guaranteed to be a singleton, so you can use it instead of the global object. Only code that are part of the same application bundle can access this `store`, making it more secured.

### Example

package A

```ts
import { getStore } from 'global-storage';
const store = getStore();
store.set('share.config.something', 123);
```

package B

```ts
import { getStore } from 'global-storage';
const store = getStore();
store.get('share.config.something'); // 123;
```

### Installation

For this to work correctly, **there must be only a single copy** of `global-storage` in `node_modules` at all times. (Similar to how there must be only a single copy of `react`.)

* For application developers, just do a regular installation. If you want to use `global-storage` directly, or have some libraries that depends on it.

```sh
npm install global-storage
```

* For library authors, you must always list this as `peerDependencies` in `package.json`. Listing it as `dependencies` may cause the library consumers to have duplicates in the final application.

In library

```json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "global-storage": "*"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "global-storage": "x.x"
  }
}
```

vs. in application

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "global-storage": "x.x"
  }
}
```

### Available functions

```ts
import { getStore } from 'global-storage';
const store = getStore();
store.has(key);
store.get<string>(key); // must specify value type via generic
store.getOrCreate(key, factory);
store.remove(key);
store.set(key);
```
